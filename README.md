# outline:none in an accessible way

Remove outline from `button` and `a`, unless the user press the `tab` key.

Based on [this article](https://jmperezperez.com/outline-focus-ring-a11y/).

## Install

```
npm i outline-none
```

## Usage

Somewhere in your client side code:

```js
require("outline-none");
```

or

```js
import "outline-none";
```

## Browser compatibility

I made the code ugly just to make it IE8+ compatible. I did not test it with IE8 though.
